      <h1> About </h1>
      <p>
          Hey! I’m Brittni Mehlhoff – the founding editor / art director / stylist of Paper & Stitch. I started this blog back in 2008 to catalog my inspirations and it unexpectedly became my full-time job. I actually quit my gig as a high-school art teacher to pursue Paper & Stitch full-time way back when and I can’t imagine doing anything else these days. <br>
          With a background in fine art (my BFA is in painting and drawing), I approach the content here on Paper & Stitch the same way I would a painting, with careful consideration mixed with joyful experimentation. Though these days when I pick up a paint brush, my blank canvas is usually one of the studio walls, a room in need of a restyling, a scrap piece of fabric, an old piece of furniture, etc. <br>
          As you might be able to guess from checking out the content around here, I create lots of DIY content – related to home decor, styling, fashion, and more. But I also love sharing interior inspirations (in 2018 I did a 12 rooms in 12 months series of room makeovers), cool travel guides (in 2017, Jeff and I are traveling at least once a month for the entire year – 12 trips in 12 months), quick and easy recipes and more. <br>
          And I’m a new mom too…casually navigating my way around the world of baby spit up and nursery design. My son, Hayes Moon, makes appearances every now and then around here and on Instagram. <br>
          If you want to chat, you can email me at brittni@papernstitch.com. I email back as many people as possible, but please keep in mind, I unfortunately cannot get back to every email personally. I do respond to blog comments quite a bit though, so if you have a post related question, that is a quicker way to get an answer. <br>

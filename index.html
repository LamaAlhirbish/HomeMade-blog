        <p> Our designer Krista is back at it again with the adorable felt animals. A couple of months ago, she designed this beautiful swan. And today she has crafted another aquatic animal—a felt sea otter stuffie! This is our first otter project on the site, so you’ll have to tell us what you think. You can also let us know if you have any requests for a new felt animal stuffie!
            Since this cute little guy spends most of his time in the sea, we gave him a small felt seashell to hold. We also cut out some paper seashells and starfish for fun. You can find the pattern for those paper cutouts in this post. Or you can cut some out of felt, instead, like we did for our mermaid headband ...

        <p> There is something a little magical about seeing all of the plants coming back to life in the springtime and the trees blossoming brightly with pretty little flowers. So why not bring that sweet, happy feeling indoors? Today we’re showing you how to make a beautiful frosted paper plum blossom branch using our paper flower pattern and a real branch.
            This is a great project for all skill levels — and you can either cut your paper flowers by hand or use your cutting machine ...

        <p> These two macrame tote bags hang beside my front door to assist me at the library, book store, or when I am heading to the farmer’s market. I have gotten so many compliments on them that when I respond with the words “DIY” or “handmade”, a new craft enthusiast is born!
            One of the great things about macrame crafting is that you can just untie your knot and try again if you make a mistake. You also don’t need much to get started — just some macrame rope and a pair of scissors! ...
